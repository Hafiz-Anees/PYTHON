# Intermediate Python Looping Questions

1. **Factorial Calculation**
   Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a `while` loop.

3. **Sum of Even Numbers**  
   Using a `for` loop, find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

4. **Prime Numbers in a Range**  
   Write a `for` loop that prints all prime numbers between two given numbers. Use nested loops to check for primality.

5. **Reverse a String**  
   Write a program that takes a string as input and reverses it using a `for` loop. Avoid using Pythonâ€™s built-in `reversed()` function.

6. **Counting Vowels and Consonants**  
Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels and consonants using a `for` loop.

7. **List Comprehension with Loops**  
Use a loop to create a new list containing the squares of each number in an input list. Implement this with a `for` loop, then try using list comprehension as well.

8. **Finding Duplicates**  
Write a program that finds and prints the duplicate elements in a list. Use a nested loop to check each element against every other element.

9. **Fibonacci Series**  
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms using a `while` loop.

10. **Filtering Odd and Even Numbers**  
 Given a list of numbers, use a loop to separate the odd and even numbers into two different lists. Then print the lists of odd and even numbers separately.
